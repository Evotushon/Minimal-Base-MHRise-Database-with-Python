# **Minimal Base MHRise Database with Python**

## **Description**

I wanted to make this project to learn OOP with Python and, when I finish it, try to replicate to use a database python library to improve this project with a database and to even use it with a discord bot so that it can give info to people who need it without going on [Kiranico](https://mhrise.kiranico.com/ "MHR Kiranico") (I'd reccomend to use this though) everytime (it's even useful when you don't have connection)

## FAQ and some questions that will surely be asked

**Will you Update the database when [Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak](https://www.monsterhunter.com/rise-sunbreak "Link to the MHR:S Official Page") will be released, in Summer 2022?**  
It's written in the title: **Base Rise** but if I have time and will I'll do it
